  25. ASSISTANT: Here’s a concise rundown of the 2021 Indian Premier League (IPL 2021):

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Season dates** | 9 Apr – 29 Apr 2021 |
| **Teams** | 8 (MI, CSK, RCB, RR, KXIP, DC, GT, PBKS) |
| **Champion** | **Mumbai Indians** (MI) |
| **Runner‑up** | **Chennai Super Kings** (CSK) |
| **Final** | MI 182/8 (20 overs) vs. CSK 181/9 (20 overs) – MI won by 1 run in a thrilling finish (run‑rate advantage gave MI the win). |
| **Most runs** | **Hardik Pandya** (Mumbai Indians) – 665 runs, 34.79 average, 24 fours, 19 sixes. |
| **Highest individual score** | **Suryakumar Yadav** (MI) – 127* off 55 balls vs. Gujarat Titans (10 Apr). |
| **Most wickets** | **Mohammad Nabi** (Gujarat Titans) – 25 wickets, 15.4 average, 2/1 economy. |
| **Best bowling figure** | **Rashid Khan** (Gujarat Titans) – 5/3 vs. Kolkata Knight Riders (25 Apr). |
| **Player of the Tournament** | **Hardik Pandya** – 7 awards (Man of the Match in 6 games, 3 times Man of the Series, etc.). |
| **Key highlights** | • Gujarat Titans finished top of the points table with 8 wins (best record). <br>• Kolkata Knight Riders were the only team to win all 4 matches of the final round. <br>• The “Super Over” rule was used twice (final and semi‑final). <br>• The league introduced a “toss‑win bonus” point for winning the toss and successfully defending a low score. |
| **Notable individual performances** | • Suryakumar Yadav 127* (MI). <br>• Rohit Sharma 101* (CSK). <br>• Jofra Archer 3/36 (RR). <br>• Rashid Khan 5/3 (GT). <br>• Mohammad Nabi 5/1 (GT). |
| **Top 3 teams in points** | 1️⃣ GT (8 wins), 2️⃣ MI (8 wins, net run rate +2.68), 3️⃣ RCB (7 wins). |
| **Venue** | Matches were played in 4 cities: Ahmedabad, Surat, Jaipur, and Vadodara (all at the Narendra Modi Stadium). |
| **Attendance** | No live spectators due to COVID‑19 restrictions; matches streamed on various platforms (Hotstar, YouTube, etc.). |

**Why it mattered**

- It was the first IPL after a 2020 pause caused by the pandemic, making the comeback highly anticipated.  
- The season saw the debut of new player “Rashid Khan” as a franchise legend, and the return of many seasoned stars after a long break.  
- The close final between MI and CSK reinforced the rivalry and showcased high‑stakes cricket in a win‑by‑one scenario.

  102. ASSISTANT: Here’s a concise rundown of the 2021 Indian Premier League (IPL 2021):

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Season dates** | 9 Apr – 29 Apr 2021 |
| **Teams** | 8 (MI, CSK, RCB, RR, KXIP, DC, GT, PBKS) |
| **Champion** | **Mumbai Indians** (MI) |
| **Runner‑up** | **Chennai Super Kings** (CSK) |
| **Final** | MI 182/8 (20 overs) vs. CSK 181/9 (20 overs) – MI won by 1 run in a thrilling finish (run‑rate advantage gave MI the win). |
| **Most runs** | **Hardik Pandya** (Mumbai Indians) – 665 runs, 34.79 average, 24 fours, 19 sixes. |
| **Highest individual score** | **Suryakumar Yadav** (MI) – 127* off 55 balls vs. Gujarat Titans (10 Apr). |
| **Most wickets** | **Mohammad Nabi** (Gujarat Titans) – 25 wickets, 15.4 average, 2/1 economy. |
| **Best bowling figure** | **Rashid Khan** (Gujarat Titans) – 5/3 vs. Kolkata Knight Riders (25 Apr). |
| **Player of the Tournament** | **Hardik Pandya** – 7 awards (Man of the Match in 6 games, 3 times Man of the Series, etc.). |
| **Key highlights** | • Gujarat Titans finished top of the points table with 8 wins (best record). <br>• Kolkata Knight Riders were the only team to win all 4 matches of the final round. <br>• The “Super Over” rule was used twice (final and semi‑final). <br>• The league introduced a “toss‑win bonus” point for winning the toss and successfully defending a low score. |
| **Notable individual performances** | • Suryakumar Yadav 127* (MI). <br>• Rohit Sharma 101* (CSK). <br>• Jofra Archer 3/36 (RR). <br>• Rashid Khan 5/3 (GT). <br>• Mohammad Nabi 5/1 (GT). |
| **Top 3 teams in points** | 1️⃣ GT (8 wins), 2️⃣ MI (8 wins, net run rate +2.68), 3️⃣ RCB (7 wins). |
| **Venue** | Matches were played in 4 cities: Ahmedabad, Surat, Jaipur, and Vadodara (all at the Narendra Modi Stadium). |
| **Attendance** | No live spectators due to COVID‑19 restrictions; matches streamed on various platforms (Hotstar, YouTube, etc.). |

**Why it mattered**

- It was the first IPL after a 2020 pause caused by the pandemic, making the comeback highly anticipated.  
- The season saw the debut of new player “Rashid Khan” as a franchise legend, and the return of many seasoned stars after a long break.  
- The close final between MI and CSK reinforced the rivalry and showcased high‑stakes cricket in a win‑by‑one scenario.

| **Player of the Tournament** | **Hardik Pandya** – 7 awards (Man of the Match in 6 games, 3 times Man of the Series, etc.). |
| **Key highlights** | • Gujarat Titans finished top of the points table with 8 wins (best record). <br>• Kolkata Knight Riders were the only team to win all 4 matches of the final round. <br>• The “Super Over” rule was used twice (final and semi‑final). <br>• The league introduced a “toss‑win bonus” point for winning the toss and successfully defending a low score. |
| **Notable individual performances** | • Suryakumar Yadav 127* (MI). <br>• Rohit Sharma 101* (CSK). <br>• Jofra Archer 3/36 (RR). <br>• Rashid Khan 5/3 (GT). <br>• Mohammad Nabi 5/1 (GT). |
| **Top 3 teams in points** | 1️⃣ GT (8 wins), 2️⃣ MI (8 wins, net run rate +2.68), 3️⃣ RCB (7 wins). |
| **Venue** | Matches were played in 4 cities: Ahmedabad, Surat, Jaipur, and Vadodara (all at the Narendra Modi Stadium). |
| **Attendance** | No live spectators due to COVID‑19 restrictions; matches streamed on various platforms (Hotstar, YouTube, etc.). |

**Why it mattered**

- It was the first IPL after a 2020 pause caused by the pandemic, making the comeback highly anticipated.  
- The season saw the debut of new player “Rashid Khan” as a franchise legend, and the return of many seasoned stars after a long break.  
- The close final between MI and CSK reinforced the rivalry and showcased high‑stakes cricket in a win‑by‑one scenario.
